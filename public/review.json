    "name": "Lindsey Buckingham",
    "about": "The guitar just had to make a broader statement, he says. Alex Lifeson reserves his most daring playing for his solos  just try wrapping your head around the extra ­terrestrial lunacy of Freewill."

    "name": "Thurston Moore",
    "about": "Springsteen didn't make any technical breakthroughs on guitar, but few players are better at coaxing emotion from steel and wood: witness the surf-rock recklessness of the Born to Run solo, the junkyard-dog bite of Adam Raised a Cain and the melancholy twang of Tougher Than the Rest."

    "about": "One of modern metals key figures, Dimebag Darrell founded Pantera with his brother, drummer Vinnie Paul Abbott forging a style that combined brutally precise, punk-honed grooves with splatter-paint melodic runs."

    "about": "Patti Smith famously described Tom Verlaine's guitar sound as a thousand bluebirds screaming. Television's leader soaked up the flavor of favorite records by John Coltrane"

    "name": "Galloway Franklin",
    "about": "Starting with her acoustic slide workout on 1971's Walking Blues, Raitt rolled out a fearsome repertoire of blues licks, fingerpicking with the best and wielding a slide like an old master. Most of all, she set a crucial precedent"

    "name": "Webb Finch",
    "about": " He's never been a monochromatic headbanger, though, delving early on into the delicate picking of Fade to Black and later embracing the more nuanced hard rock of the Black Album. I wonder if James Hetfield knows how to play the drums"
