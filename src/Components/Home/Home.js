            Electric guitars feature devices called pickups embedded in their
            bodies. Pickups convert the vibrations of the strings into an
            electric signal, which is then sent to an amplifier over a shielded
            cable. The amplifier converts the electric signal into sound and
            plays it."The guitar just had to make a broader statement," he says.
            Alex Lifeson reserves his most daring playing for his solos just try
            wrapping your head around the extraÂ­ terrestrial lunacy of
            "Freewill."
